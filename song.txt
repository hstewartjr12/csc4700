Goodbye by SR-71

I'm everything you know
You wonder friend or foe
I'm the burning in your throat when you swallow
But then you spit me out
Your stomach full of doubt
Now you're faking every word out of your mouth

But you won't let go
It's all about control
Understand I'm born to lead you will follow

Now I don't wanna stay
And I'm running away
Don't you hear me when I say

Goodbye
So long
Nice try
I'm gone
You don't like being second
I don't like being wrong

I won't forget the way you made me feel
I won't regret running away from here
So I'll say goodbye again
So I'll say goodbye again



Now it's there to see
You've forgotten me
Ever since I was the prince among the thieves
So you hold me down
Strip away my crown
Can't contain me knowing all the truth I found

Always thinking small
Helping me to fall
Now your jealousy and hate consumes us all
I don't wanna stay
I'm running away
Don't you hear me when I say

Goodbye
So long
Nice try
I'm gone
You don't like being second
I don't like being wrong

I won't forget the way you made me feel
I won't regret running away from here
You think you see the world, but you see nothing
Time is only gonna make it worse in the end
So I'll say goodbye again


Don't hit me with your fears
I don't fit with your ideas
You missed what I'm about
I earned my way out
And in the end
I'll say goodbye again

I won't forget the way you made me feel
I won't regret running away from here
I won't forget the way you made me feel
I won't regret
So I'll say goodbye again

(Goodbye)

So I'll say goodbye again

(Goodbye)
(So long)
(Nice try)
(I'm gone)
So I'll say goodbye again

(Goodbye)
(So long)
(Nice try)
(I'm gone)
So I'll say goodbye again


(Goodbye)
(So long)
(Nice try)
(I'm gone)
So I'll say goodbye again
