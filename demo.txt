What is your favorite movie?

I don't watch too many movies, but I loved The Batman, which just came out, so that'd be my choice.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

Haven't really thought about it, but maybe somewhere in Japan like Tokyo.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

Maybe self-replication. Specifically, I'd want to be able to clone myself, and when I make the clone 
disappear, I retain the memories of the clone. This seems like a very handy power for getting things 
done or learning new things much quicker. Unlike some other choices I was considering, like 
immortality or super speed, I can't think of any potential major drawbacks with this power as long as 
it's used carefully and not abused. Still, with this type of question, there's likely some issue I'm just not 
thinking of.
